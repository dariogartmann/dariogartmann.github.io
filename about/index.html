                <p>
                    I am 24 years old and currently in my last semester of the Bachelor's degree Multimedia Production at <a target="_blank" class="fancylink" href="https://fhgr.ch">FHGR</a>. What started out as a hobby roughly five years ago, has now become my day-to-day activity. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    What excites me most about filmmaking is telling stories that would otherwise be unheard of. As a filmmaker I get a glimpse into various fields. I always strive to create beautiful imagery that's inspiring and fits the subject. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    In my spare time I love to travel and explore exciting new places â€“ always carrying my camera. Head over to my Instagram for a more personal glimpse into my life.
