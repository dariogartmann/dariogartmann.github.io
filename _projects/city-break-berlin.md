## Modul 152
One class during my apprenticeship was called "Embedding multimedia elements in websites". The task was to create a website, video and some photos. As we got to choose our own subject, and the trip was just around the corner, I decided for "City-Break Berlin".<br/>You can check out the result [here](http://webseiten.informatik.sg/ina4a/gruppe1/){:target="_blank"}.
