title: Iron Man Short
description: "First Flight is a short clip I created as part of a minor module during my studies. The task was to create anything we could imagine. It just had to include some kind of visual effects. Being a big Iron Man fan I tried my hand at the famous HUD effect of Tony Stark. The result is this video."

            <p>The display elements were created in 2D with Adobe Illustrator. In After Effects I made them 3D by moving them along the Z axis. To make them seem more realistic I used various filters like grain and glow to make it appear as if it were a real hologram in the heads up display.<br/>This workflow allowed me to animate the various paths of the illustration in After Effects.</p>
