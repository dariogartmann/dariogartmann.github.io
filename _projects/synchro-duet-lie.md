title: Synchro Duet LIE
description: "Marluce and Lara are a synchronised swimming duet from Liechtenstein.
 They are currently working hard towards the Olympics 2020 in Tokyo. As their training is quite expensive, they started a campaign on the site «i believe in you» to realise their dream. <br/><br/>I got to create this short promotion video for them, which they could use
 to find sponsors.<br/><br/>"

            <p>The biggest challenge of this project was filming the underwater scenes. For this I used a fairly cheap bag, that was created for this exact purpose. Framing the shots was hard, as the light refracted in the plastic of the bag. But with a few attempts, we managed to get amazing results.<br/><br/>Luckily, the Sony a7 III has pretty good autofocus, as moving the focus ring (or using any button at all on the camera) was nearly impossible.
