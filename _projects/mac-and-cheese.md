title: Mac'n'Cheese
description: "As a challenge to try something new and build new skills, I created a short «cinematic food b-roll» sequence. My flatmate was cooking and I filmed him. Then I cut together a fast paced clip with a focus on sound design.<br/><br/>
It's definitely not where I want it to be yet, but for my first attempt I am quite happy with it. Already looking forward to the next one!"
