            <p>The goal was to create a short promo video with fitting music for his Instagram account. Since Instagram limits the duration of videos to 60 seconds, we didnâ€™t have much space. Nonetheless the result came out pretty good in my opinion.<br/>The video ended up being a fast paced summary of a training unit. It also follows the basic structure of intro-main-ending, although it had to be short.
