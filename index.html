        <p>
            My name is Dario Gartmann. I am 19 years old and currently attending an apprenticeship as a software developer. During my training I grew particularly interested in webdesign. I like being able to combine webdesign with taking photographs and recording films; two of my hobbies. 

            In my spare time I love to travel and explore exciting new places â€“ always carrying my camera.
