            <p>Our first stop was Skopje, the capital and largest city of North Macedonia. A guide showed us around the older parts of Skopje, before visiting the crowded center.</p>
            <p>On the next day we headed southwest of Skopje to visit Canyon Matka, which is actually a reservoir lake. Lunch there was delicious, and a boat then took us across the lake.</p>
