        <div class="half">
            <p>The announcement of the theme 'blue' marked the start of the 72 hour time period in which we had to come up with an idea.<br />After thinking through some possible stories, we decided to make our story about a guy who skips work because he had a rough night. If you translate 'to make blue' directly to German, you get 'blau machen'. This phrase means the same as 'to skip work'.<br />We got the shoot done in a day and had the whole other day to edit the short. It was a very fun and educational weekend, I'm looking forward to next years theme!</p>
