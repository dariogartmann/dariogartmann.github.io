            <p>This project started in late December 2020 and the last clip was recorded in late February of 2021. During this time the tulips have fully grown.<br />
            I worked without a storyboard, just the idea of Â«following the tulips' lifeÂ». I tried to include some transitions to show the passage of time. I'm especially happy with how the first turned out, where they plant the bulbs and cover them â€“ and the camera â€“Â with soil. The view then emerges from the dirt to show how the watered tulips have started to grow.</p>
