            <p>Upon arrival in Wellington I immediatly met the group. We got drinks and burgers at a bar. Since I had been on the road for 40 hours at that point, I went to bed pretty early.<br /><br />
            The next morning we packed our bags in our little van and started the journey by taking the ferry to Picton on the South Island.</p>

            <p>I was having such a great time with the group, I didn't press the record button as much as I had actually planned. Nonetheless, I still managed to put together a short clip with some impressions.</p>
