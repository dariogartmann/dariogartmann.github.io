            <p>The biggest challenge of this project was filming the underwater scenes. For this I used a fairly cheap bag, that was created for this exact purpose. Framing the shots was hard, as the light refracted in the plastic of the bag. But with a few attempts, we managed to get amazing results.<br /><br />Luckily, the Sony a7 III has pretty good autofocus, as moving the focus ring (or using any button at all on the camera) was nearly impossible.
