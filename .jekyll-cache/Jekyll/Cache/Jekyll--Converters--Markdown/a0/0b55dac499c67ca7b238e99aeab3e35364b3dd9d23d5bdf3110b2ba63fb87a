            <h3>From Bulb to Flower</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="half">
            <p>This project started in late December 2020 and the last clip was recorded in late February of 2021. During this time the tulips have fully grown.<br />
            I worked without a storyboard, just the idea of «following the tulips' life». I tried to include some transitions to show the passage of time. I'm especially happy with how the first turned out, where they plant the bulbs and cover them – and the camera – with soil. The view then emerges from the dirt to show how the watered tulips have started to grow.</p>
